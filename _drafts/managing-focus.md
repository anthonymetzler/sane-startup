title: Managing Focus
---

If you are in a management level position then it is imperative that you protect your employees from focus disruption as much as possible.

What I've found to be effective is to keep priorities as long as possible, but if I have an inkling of a change-up coming then broadly extrovert the idea to the group. It keeps people heads down on the priorities at hand, but increases people comfort with upcoming change and gives a sense of inclusion.
Constantly pivoting focus erodes the organization.

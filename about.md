  Hey there and welcome, let me start things off with a disclaimer:<br />
  - I can be wrong.<br />
  - I do not know everything.<br />
  - I am guilty of making plenty of bad decisions.<br />

The Sane Startup blog is a practical guide to fostering sane culture while working at a startup. I feel that there are too many organizations out there trapped in negative patterns and self-inflicting many of their problems. I truly believe there are straight-forward ways to address these problems and better the startup environment.

Working at a startup is one of the most wonderful and rewarding experiences one can have. I possess a strong entrepreneurial spirit, so the problems and challenges faced in scaling a startup are the ones I find most inspiring. However, too often in the tech startup industry these positive defining attributes become excuses in making short-sighted decisions.

The problems that startups face are difficult enough, so preventing as much self-inflicted damage as possible is priority number one. There are too many smart people working collectively across startups to continually make these easily preventable mistakes. Let me challenge your perspective and share my thoughts on how we can elevate positive practices within startup culture.

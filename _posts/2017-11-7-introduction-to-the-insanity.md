title: Introduction to the Insanity
---
Working in startups is insanity, it’s the very definition of it.

But not for the reasons you might think.

Most people would describe startup culture as some combination of exciting, agile, fast-paced, progressive, impactful, and innovative — and they would be right.

It could simultaneously be described as chaotic, reactive, distracting, and lean. There’s good reason these qualities are so prevalent: it’s because you’re working tirelessly to scratch out your existence.

For all these negative attributes, they’re not the reason being in a startup is insane.

What IS insane, is that companies repeatedly self-inflict many of these negative experiences. They never reach a point of internal stability to foster sane scalability.

There is too much damn emphasis on simply “working hard” at startups.

End this insanity now! Stop repeating the mistakes of all the startups before you, such as:

- Being over dependent on the individual
- Lack of checkpoints and health checks
- Solving problems by brute force by over hiring
- Culture instability
- Operational volatility

My recommendation is to truly prioritize and invest the time to fix efficiency problems early on as well as installing safety checks within your processes.

People work faster when they’re confident they aren’t going to mess up and you can't establish accountability without guidelines. Focus on working hard at working smart.

Most scale oriented problems are significantly cheaper to resolve sooner than later, so do not delay.

Run sane startups today!

title: Introduction to the Insanity
---

Working in startups is insanity — it’s the very definition of it.

But not for the reasons you might think.

Most people would describe startup culture as some combination of exciting, agile, fast-paced, progressive, impactful, and innovative — and they would be right.

It could simultaneously be described as chaotic, reactive, distracting, and short-sighted. There’s good reason these qualities are so prevalent: it’s because you’re working tirelessly to scratch out your existence.

For all these negative attributes, they’re not the reason being in a startup is insane.

What IS insane, is that companies repeatedly self-inflict these negative experiences. They never reach a point of internal stability to foster sane scalability.

There is too much damn emphasis on simply “working hard” at start-ups.

End this insanity now — stop repeating the mistakes of all the startups before you.

- Over hiring
- Over dependent on the individual
- Lack of health checks
- Culture instability
- Operational volatility

Prioritize the time to fix your problems early on and install safety checks within your processes.

People work faster when they’re confident they aren’t going to f*ck up.

Focus on working hard at working smart. Most scale oriented problems are significantly cheaper to resolve sooner than later, so do not delay.

Run sane startups today!

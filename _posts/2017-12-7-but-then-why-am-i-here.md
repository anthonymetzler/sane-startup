title: But, Then Why Am I Here?

One of the biggest mistakes you can make when working with specialists, is to approach work estimations like a negotiation.

Remember, this person was hired for their skillset and mastery of craft, so preemptively questioning their value is just going to piss them off.

This does not mean overestimations don't occur, but I challenge you to resolve these issues by asking discovery questions rather than negotiating.

My belief is that if you ask questions about the process then you'll better understand the work at hand and come to a mutually expected outcome for the project.

I am a firm believer in knowing a little bit about everything - it helps you better communicate with those you engage and identify parallels between systems.

I think that when work estimates are hotly negotiated the result is a project inevitably running long or falling short.

Avoid pressuring someone into agreeing to a timeline that they already know is going to miss the mark, work estimations need to be as win-win as realistically possible.

Another popular attempt to resolve timeline problems is usually to "assign additional resources", however, quantity of labor has diminishing returns.

You can't hire 100 contractors to successfully remodel a bathroom in an hour, but you can probably hire four to do it in 20 hours - right size the team to maximize efficiency.

My mantra for project leadership is this: if you engage and empower a team by proactively communicating context and expectations then for the most part people will return the favor.

People really appreciate a heads up and it enables them to use foresight when making decisions in their work.

Foster proactivity, don't cut it short â€” the goal is sanity.

The hardest decisions are usually the right ones, because they require restraint.

Startups suffering from organizational ADHD commonly struggle with defining the steps towards their future goals and applying their knowledge in successfully completing each step.
What takes their focus is the present and solving all the inevitably immediate issues.

(Yes - I do know it's a startup and that's the nature of the beast.)

However, the great traits of startup culture, multi-tasking and pivoting, are often overly abused. Context switching consumes and the organization gets addicted to hacks and quick-wins.

If not managed, healthy and sustainable practices will never take root, because there is too much outstanding work to be done without a massive slow-down of velocity or increase of labor.

Using foresight is always best practice.

My mantra is this: The decision I making now is setting a precedent for those who come after me; would I be satisfied if my fellow employee was completing this task in the same manner?

Now executing best practices from the beginning is insanely difficult, because there is an upfront investment in documentation, building out processes, and configuring automation.

Therefore, reigning in on multi-tasking and context switching is crucial. Select a limited number of initiatives to pursue, define the phases of the project, and time box your investment.

If you have these things identified, then you must commit and start executing best practices from the very beginning.

Now remember, show restraint and do not rush - give your initiatives adequate time to prove themselves.
